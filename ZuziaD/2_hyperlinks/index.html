                    _blank: Load the URL into a new browsing context. This is usually a tab, 
                    but users can configure browsers to use new windows instead.
                    _parent: Load the URL into the parent browsing context of the current one. 
                    If there is no parent, this behaves the same way as _self.
                    _top: Load the URL into the top-level browsing context 
                    (that is, the "highest" browsing context that is an ancestor of the current one, and has no parent). 
                    If there is no parent, this behaves the same way as _self.-->
